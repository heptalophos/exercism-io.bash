 ✓ Sequence of two protein codons translates into proteins
 ✓ Sequence of two different protein codons translates into proteins
 ✓ Translate RNA strand into correct protein list
 ✓ Translation stops if STOP codon at beginning of sequence
 ✓ Translation stops if STOP codon at end of two-codon sequence
 ✓ Translation stops if STOP codon at end of three-codon sequence
 ✓ Translation stops if STOP codon in middle of three-codon sequence
 ✓ Translation stops if STOP codon in middle of six-codon sequence
 ✓ Sequence of two non-STOP codons does not translate to a STOP codon
 ✓ Error case
 ✓ Non-existing codon can't translate
 ✓ Unknown amino acids, not part of a codon, can't translate
 ✓ Incomplete RNA sequence can't translate
 ✓ Incomplete RNA sequence can translate if valid until a STOP codon
